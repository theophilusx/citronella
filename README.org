* citronella

A library for writing text based interfaces for Clojure similar to ncurses. The
library is based on the [[https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna][Lanterna]] Java library. The library provides three levels
of abstraction, from a low level basic terminal, a buffered screen and a high
level graphics terminal with some higher level abstractions, like panels and
buttons.

** Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

#+begin_example
  $ clojure -A:test:runner -M:runner
#+end_example

Build a deployable jar of this library:

#+begin_example
  $ clojure -A:jar -M:jar
#+end_example

Install it locally:

#+begin_example
  $ clojure -A:install -M:install
#+end_example

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables:

#+begin_example
  $ clojure -A:deploy -M:deploy
#+end_example
